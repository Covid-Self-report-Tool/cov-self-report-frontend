    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>
      XXX is a COVID-19 self-reporting tool that aggregates crowdsourced data to
      aid in predictive modeling of the viral spread. Predictive modeling will
      help us strategize solutions to curb the spread of and potentially support
      eradication of COVID-19. By adding your information to this site you can
      supplement the information available from the CDC, WHO, and ECDC you can
      add to the data available that help scientists and medical workers fight
      this disease. Your contributions will be anonymous?

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      As scientists we understand that data critical for developing a true and
      realistic understanding of COVID-19. Moved by the grave pandemic facing
      all of us, we felt it was our duty as individuals with advanced training
      in the sciences to come together and create a tool that fills the gaps in
      our knowledge for COVID-19.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the major problems facing our global community at this time is the
      lack of testing. Presently, most countries only offer testing to
      individuals in critical conditions or those who are hospitalized. Because
      of this, many individuals arenâ€™t being tested for COVID-19 and official
      global data on the number of people infected with the virus, and the viral
      spread are inaccurate and misleading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motivated by this problem we have come together to combine our skills and
      create a tool that will create more transparency on the spread of COVID-19
      and provide the data we need to overcome this pandemic as a global
      community.

      I communicated with a law firm willing to volunteer (McDermott Wills and
      Emory). They help us at the archive and will see if they can help an
      unincorporated group of individuals (Guneeta)
